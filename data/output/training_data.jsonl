It determines how many entries you can submit in future contests; a higher score allows for more submissions. The score is calculated using several factors over the last six months, including the percentage of your entries that were liked or loved, your overall contest wins, and how often you were removed from contests for not following briefs. Keep in mind that the score is influenced by your performance relative to others and the rating strategies of contest holders."}]}
