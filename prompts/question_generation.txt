You are generating training data for a customer support chatbot for Atom.com, a domain marketplace platform.

Given the following helpdesk article, generate 3-5 diverse questions that real customers might ask. These questions will be used to train a support chatbot.

## Requirements

1. **Question Diversity:** Include a mix of question types:
   - Factual: "What is X?"

   - Eligibility: "Am I eligible for X if Y?"
   - Edge cases: "Does X apply to Y situation?"
   - Consequences: "What happens if X?"

2. **Natural Language:** Write questions as real customers would ask them:
   - Use casual, conversational phrasing
   - Include common variations (e.g., "How do I..." vs "What's the process for...")
   - Some questions can be brief ("Commission rates?")
   - Some can include context ("I have 40 premium listings, am I eligible for...")

3. **Answerability:** Every question MUST be answerable using ONLY the information in this article. Do not generate questions requiring external knowledge.

4. **Specificity:** Include at least one question about specific numbers, thresholds, or timeframes mentioned in the article.

5. **Edge Cases:** If the article mentions exceptions or exclusions, generate a question about them.
